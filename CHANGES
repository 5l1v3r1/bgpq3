0.1.6 (2008-08-08): 
	- maxsockbuf call added, that can help with pipelining of really large
	as-sets.
	- new key -M <extra match condition> for juniper route-filters, f.e.: 
    bgpq3 -JEM "protocol bgp;\n    community no-export" -l PolicyName/TermName 
	will generate term with additional match conditions, like: 

	policy-options {
	 policy-statement PolicyName {
	  term TermName {
	replace:
	   from {
	    protocol bgp;
	    community no-export;
	    route-filter 10.0.0.0/24 exact;
	   }
	  }
	 }
	}

0.1.5 (2008-06-02): 
	- route-set's expansion added. Fully functional for IPv4 prefixes, but
	not for IPv6 - only those prefixes explicitely marked as 'member-of: RS..'
	will be expanded. This is due to limitation in IRRd.
	- extended access-lists (Cisco) and route-filters (Juniper) generation
	is supported now with new -E key. For Cisco ipv6 access-lists is not
	yet supported. 

0.1.4 (2008-05-30): 
	- bugfix for juniper as-path group generation. Thanks to Alexander Shikoff.

0.1.3 (2008-05-20): 
	- aggregation (-A) now supported for Cisco prefix-lists. 
	- pipelining now can be enabled for RIPE-style queries too (ipv6). 
	- more-specific routes (-R len) feature ported from bgpq
	- pipelining now set by default. -T flag now disables pipelining.
	- strlcpy.c imported into sources. Not found on Linux :) 

0.1.2 (2008-05-19): 
	- final support for asn32, now with correct syntax for Juniper. 
	- experimental 'pipelining' mode (flag -T), much faster when 
	working with big as-set's. 
	- RIPE-style query (-i origin) now requests only route6 objects. 

0.1.1 (2008-05-16): 
	- initial support for asn32 added (flag -3). By default it's off, 
	and when bgpq sees 32-bit asn in resolver queue, it either replaces
	it with AS23456 (in as-path generation mode) or queries radb for
	prefixes with that origin. 
	Note: for now only JunOS 9.1 can handle asn32, not Cisco IOS..
