0.1.3 (2008-05-20): 
	- aggregation (-A) now supported for Cisco prefix-lists. 

0.1.2 (2008-05-19): 
	- final support for asn32, now with correct syntax for Juniper. 
	- experimental 'pipelining' mode (flag -T), much faster when 
	working with big as-set's. 
	- RIPE-style query (-i origin) now requests only route6 objects. 

0.1.1 (2008-05-16): 
	- initial support for asn32 added (flag -3). By default it's off, 
	and when bgpq sees 32-bit asn in resolver queue, it either replaces
	it with AS23456 (in as-path generation mode) or queries radb for
	prefixes with that origin. 
	Note: for now only JunOS 9.1 can handle asn32, not Cisco IOS..
