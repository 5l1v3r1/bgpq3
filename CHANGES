0.1.22   (2014-07-27)
    - bugfix: allow network object with stray spaces after prefix length.
    Found by Tom Eichhorn in 2620:74:14::/48 (VeriSign Route6, RADB).
    - bugfix: networks with leading zeros (02.51.252.0/22, as4787) are not
    parsed correctly in inet_ntop.. Found by Tom Eichhorn.

0.1.21   (2014-06-05)
    - new flag -b: generate prefix-filters for BIRD (http://bird.network.cz),
    contributed by Job Snijders.
    
0.1.20-todo2 (2014-05-01)
    - new flag -r <len>, allowing bgpq to generate limited set of more-specific
    routes - only routes with prefix-length >= <len> are accepted. 
    Thanks to Pavel Gulchouck for suggesion. 

0.1.20-todo (2013-10-07)
    - socket close code fixed. Thanks to Martin J. Levy.
    - new flag -4, "force ipv4". Actually does a little more than allowing
    for pedantic checks. Thanks to Martin J. Levy.

0.1.19 (2013-05-09)
    - CLANG compilation issues fixed.
    - bgpq3.spec added. Thanks to Arnoud Vermeer.
    
0.1.18 (2013-01-08)
    - JSON output format. Thanks to Job Snijders (Atrato Networks).

0.1.17 (2012-10-25)
    - route-sets handling in command-line added. Thanks to Alexandr Turovsky
    for pointing out.
    - bug in aggregation documentation fixed. Thanks to Nikolay Shopik.

0.1.16 (2012-01-19)
    - new option -m <len>: maximum length of accepted prefixes. 
    Suggested by Eugene Demidov, used to discard 'too long prefixes'
    (like /30-/32) even if they are registered in IRR. By default 
    limit is not set and all prefixes accepted.
    - documentation redesigned into text/markdown and text/html (manpage 
    supported still).

0.1.15 (2011-07-15)
    - prefix-set's for Cisco IOS XR now supported too. 

0.1.14 (2011-06-18)
    - Fixed bug in sx_maxsockbuf in rare cases of OS maxsockbuf >2M. 
    Thanks to Andreas Lundin.

0.1.13 (2011-06-14)
    - never publically released.

0.1.12 (2010-10-08)
    - Fixed bug preventing AS262144 (that's AS4.0 in asdot) to expand. 
    Thanks to Sergey Matveychuk

0.1.11 (2010-04-19)
    - Fixed another bug in aggregation (-A) mode, thanks to Dmitry Tejblum.

0.1.10 (2009-06-13)
    - Fixed bug in aggregation (-A) mode, thanks to Sergey Gonchar. 

0.1.9 (2009-03-27)
    - RIPE changed ASN32 notation to asplain. And RADB does not support
    asplain indexing (yet?).... Fixed. Thanks to Pavel Gluchouk. 

0.1.8 (2008-12-25)
    - new flag -D for Cisco asdot notation. Cisco behaviour is a bit
    strange for me, but, well, that's their decision: 
When the asdot format is enabled as the default, any regular expressions 
to match 4-byte autonomous system numbers must be written using the asdot 
format, or else the regular expression match will fail.

        #wp3521658 (note the URL wrap). 

0.1.7 (2008-12-19): 
    - man page. Finally :) 
    - option -h now means not help, but now it can be used to point to 
    alternate IRRD host, like in old bgpq.

0.1.6 (2008-08-08): 
    - maxsockbuf call added, that can help with pipelining of really large
    as-sets.
    - new key -M <extra match condition> for juniper route-filters, f.e.: 
    bgpq3 -JEM "protocol bgp;\n    community no-export" -l PolicyName/TermName 
    will generate term with additional match conditions, like: 

    policy-options {
     policy-statement PolicyName {
      term TermName {
    replace:
       from {
        protocol bgp;
        community no-export;
        route-filter 10.0.0.0/24 exact;
       }
      }
     }
    }

0.1.5 (2008-06-02): 
    - route-set's expansion added. Fully functional for IPv4 prefixes, but
    not for IPv6 - only those prefixes explicitely marked as 'member-of: RS..'
    will be expanded. This is due to limitation in IRRd.
    - extended access-lists (Cisco) and route-filters (Juniper) generation
    is supported now with new -E key. For Cisco ipv6 access-lists is not
    yet supported. 

0.1.4 (2008-05-30): 
    - bugfix for juniper as-path group generation. Thanks to Alexander Shikoff.

0.1.3 (2008-05-20): 
    - aggregation (-A) now supported for Cisco prefix-lists. 
    - pipelining now can be enabled for RIPE-style queries too (ipv6). 
    - more-specific routes (-R len) feature ported from bgpq
    - pipelining now set by default. -T flag now disables pipelining.
    - strlcpy.c imported into sources. Not found on Linux :) 

0.1.2 (2008-05-19): 
    - final support for asn32, now with correct syntax for Juniper. 
    - experimental 'pipelining' mode (flag -T), much faster when 
    working with big as-set's. 
    - RIPE-style query (-i origin) now requests only route6 objects. 

0.1.1 (2008-05-16): 
    - initial support for asn32 added (flag -3). By default it's off, 
    and when bgpq sees 32-bit asn in resolver queue, it either replaces
    it with AS23456 (in as-path generation mode) or queries radb for
    prefixes with that origin. 
    Note: for now only JunOS 9.1 can handle asn32, not Cisco IOS..
